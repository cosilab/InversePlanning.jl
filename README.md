# InversePlanning.jl

An architecture for planning, inverse planning, and inference in planning,
using [PDDL](https://github.com/JuliaPlanners/PDDL.jl) and [Gen](https://www.gen.dev/).

## Setup

To use this library in your own projects, press `]` at the Julia REPL to
enter the package manager, then run:

```julia-repl
add PDDL SymbolicPlanners
add Gen GenParticleFilters
add PDDLViz GLMakie
add https://github.com/probcomp/InversePlanning.jl.git
```

To explore the examples provided in this repository, clone this repository,
press `]` at the Julia REPL to enter the package manager, then run the following
commands:

```julia-repl
activate examples
dev ./
instantiate
```

This will activate the `examples` directory as the project environment, set up
your cloned copy of InversePlanning.jl as a dependency, and install any
remaining dependencies.

## Examples

InversePlanning.jl can be used to model agents that perform model-based heuristic search
to achieve their goals. Below, we visualize a sampled trace for a replanning
agent that interleaves resource-bounded plan search with plan execution:

We can then perform goal inference for these agents:

Notice that the correct goal is eventually inferred, despite backtracking
by the agent. This is because we model the agent as *boundedly rational*:
it does not always produce optimal plans. Indeed, this modeling assumption
also allows us to infer goals from *failed plans*:

Because we use the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as our underlying
state representation, our architecture supports a large range of domains,
including the classic Blocks World:
